# AC Visualizer
I'm thinking two classes in AC Circuits right now and I'm absolutely fascinated about the concept of how impedences are able to change the effectice power by shifiting signals. As a visual learner, I decided to make a tool that visualizes this, as while are online circuit simulators, there are none showing the unit circle creating the offsets and showing how it all relates to the angle of impedence. Currently, all that is done is a simple RLC Circuits but I intend to further with this project. A preview picture of the web app so far:
